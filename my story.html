                <h2>How It All Started</h2>
                <p>My name is Sylvia Nyaga, and I've always been fascinated by how creativity and 
                    technology come together to build beautiful things. Growing up, I was the kind of person 
                    who loved experimenting. Whether it was sketching designs, customizing my phone or helping
                    friends fix small tech issues. I never realized it then, but those small curosities were
                    the first step into the world of web develoment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When i wrote the first few lines of HTML, I felt like I'd unlocked a secret 
                    language that could bring my ideas to life. Over time, I started exploring
                    CSS to make pages more stylish and later Javascript to make them interactive.
                    What started as a hobby slowly turned into a passion and that passion has shaped
                    who I am today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond coding, I'm deeply ispired by storytelling. I believe every website tells 
                    a story of a brand, a dream or a person and my goal is to use design and development
                    to tell this stories beautifully. I'm currently working on growing my skills
                    to become a full-stack web developer and one day create digital experiences that
                    make people smile, think and connect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This journey has taught me patience,problem-solving and the importance of always 
                    staying curious. Each line of code I write is a reminder that growth happens step
                    by step and I'm just getting started.
